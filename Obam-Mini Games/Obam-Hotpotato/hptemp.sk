options:#                                  ::::::::INSTRUCTIONS::::::::	
#							step 1
#							-	you have to run a set of commands
#							-	/setpoint [coursename] at the spawn location of your arena
#							-	/setdeathpoint [coursename] at the respawn are of your arena
#							-	/lobbyhpset [coursename] at the lobby spawn area of your arena
#							-	a sign needs to be placed where you plan on its use in the lobby area
#							-	the first line needs to be 'lobby'
#							-	the second line needs to be the course name
#							-	/svs add <server> /lobbyjoin <player> [coursename] then add this command to your sign
#							step 2 fill in these two spots:
	
	
	coursename.%script% :SnowyHills#<----- put your coursename here! Be sure it matches spelling and spaceing to the what you used above
	worldname.%script% :hotpotatoSnowyHills#<----- Put your world name here! be sure it matches spelling and spacing to what is on the MV list. DO NOT USE ALIASES AND DO NOT SET ALIASES!
	
	
#							step 3
#							-	save as "hpCOURSENAME.sk"
#							-	upload to the "hotpotato" folder on the OBAMGAMING Copy Drive.
#							-	bam boom... youre done.
